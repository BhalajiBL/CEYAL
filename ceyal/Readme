# **Process Mining Software with Blockchain and Predictive Analysis**

## **Overview**
This project is a comprehensive process mining software that enables users to analyze business processes by visualizing workflows, predicting future process outcomes, and securely storing process data on a blockchain. Key features include cost and time prediction, real-time process monitoring, action-oriented alerts, and future predictive analysis using machine learning models.

---

## **Features**
- **Process Mining Engine**: Discovers and visualizes workflows from event logs.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Securely stores event log data on a blockchain for immutability and transparency.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Uses machine learning models to predict process bottlenecks, costs, and completion times.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Tracks ongoing processes and provides alerts for deviations or potential delays.
- **Cost and Time Prediction**: Predicts future costs and time requirements for process completion.
- **Custom Dashboards**: Displays key performance metrics and visualizations for process analysis.

## **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x
- Node.js (for frontend development)
- PostgreSQL or MongoDB (for database)
- Ethereum/Hyperledger Fabric (for blockchain setup)
- Docker (optional, for running blockchain nodes locally)
  
### **Steps**

#### 1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/process-mining-software.git
cd process-mining-software
```

#### 2. **Backend Setup**
1. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. **Install the required Python packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Configure the database**:
   - Update `backend/config.py` with your database credentials.
   - Create the database schema by running the migration command (if using Flask/Django).
   ```bash
   flask db upgrade   # for Flask users
   ```

4. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   python backend/app.py
   ```

#### 3. **Frontend Setup**
1. **Install frontend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the frontend server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

#### 4. **Blockchain Setup**
1. **If using Ethereum (Ganache for local development)**:
   - Install [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) and start it.
   - Deploy the smart contracts:
     ```bash
     cd blockchain
     truffle migrate
     ```

2. **If using Hyperledger**:
   - Follow the [Hyperledger Fabric setup guide](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/getting_started.html) to configure nodes and deploy smart contracts.

#### 5. **Real-Time Monitoring Setup**
1. **Start Apache Kafka for event streaming**:
   ```bash
   cd kafka
   ./bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
   ./bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
   ```

2. **Configure and start the real-time monitoring service**:
   - Set up the WebSocket or event listener in the `backend` to send real-time updates to the frontend.

## **Usage**

### **Process Mining**
1. Upload your event logs (CSV, XES format) via the frontend.
2. The process mining engine will automatically visualize the workflow based on the event log data.

### **Blockchain Storage**
- Once the event log is processed, the results will be stored securely on the blockchain.
- Use the "Blockchain Explorer" feature in the UI to view the transaction history and stored data.

### **Predictive Analysis**
- Navigate to the "Predictions" section to forecast process outcomes, including bottlenecks and time/cost predictions.
- The system will provide machine learning-based predictions based on historical event logs.

### **Real-Time Monitoring**
- Go to the "Live Monitoring" dashboard to view the ongoing processes.
- Set up custom alerts to be notified of anomalies or delays.
